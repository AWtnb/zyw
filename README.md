# fuzZY Walker

Traverse directory and select path with fuzzy-finder.


```
> .\zyw.exe -h

  -all
        switch to search including file
  -exclude string
        directory name to skip (comma-separated)
  -root string
        root of traversal
```

The directory where the [`.root`](.root) is placed should be the starting point of the traversal.
